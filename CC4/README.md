# Coding Challenge 4

## This coding challenge was starting to utilize Arcpy. In this CC, an ArcGIS tool was applied to understand how Arcpy can be used to run ArcGIS through python. Isocluter Unsupervised classification was chosen to test it out. The Iso Cluster Unsupervised Classification tool automatically finds the clusters in an image and outputs a classified image without users intervention for classification sampling.
