# Coding Challenge 5
## In this CC, Arcpy and CSV were imported to generate a heatmap feature for specieses that are listed in the CSV file. Firstly, point features were generated from the information (Lat and Long) from CSV file. Based on the maximum and minimum extent value, a Fishnet shapefile was generated. Heatmap was finally produced by spatially joining the Point and Fishnet features together.
## The output of this script is a heatmap shapefile for each species that are listed in the CSV.
